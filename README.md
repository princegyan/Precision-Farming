# PrecisionFarming
This is a final year project work by Prince Alfred Gyan and Dennis Effa Amponsah. It  employs the use of IOT to monitor, store and analyse soil conditions in a green house to enhance crop production. The microcontroller used is the raspberry pi.

# Abstract
As per the advancement pattern of current agriculture and the prerequisites for science and technology. The conventional farming chiefly depend on common assets and low work costs. It’s troublesome and inefficient, and the remaining task at hand is heavy. So it cannot meet the necessities of present day agriculture which is high-yield, high quality, efficient, safe and ecological. Because the IOT (Internet of Things) innovation was connected to agriculture, the modernization and the data innovation of farming have been significantly improved. The paper presents the idea of IOT and outlines applications in the cutting edge breeding, crop growth, quality and safety of agricultural products checking with IOT to concentrate on its several technologies. The paper calls attention to issues of IOT applications in horticulture and prospects for what’s to come. Today agriculture is embedded with advanced service like GPS, sensors that empower to communicate to one another examine the information and furthermore exchange information among them. IT gives services such as cloud to agriculture. Agriculture cloud and IT services gives an extraordinary expertise administration to farmers] with respect to cultivation of crops, pricing, fertilizers ,diseases detail method of cure to be used Scientist working on agriculture will provide their discoveries, in regards to present day techniques for cultivation ,utilization of composts can acquire the historical backdrop of the locale.
